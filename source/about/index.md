Hello and welcome to my blog! My name is Bart and I'm software developer and architect.
I used to work with different technologies, the most recent being Microsoft stack (.NET).
I put a lot of attention to quality of the solutions I work on - from technical, business and usability perspective.
Currently I'm focusing on functional and reactive programming, especially on F# language.
My areas of interest for future development are data science and machine learning.

If you want to get in touch with me don't hesitate to mail me: _bart (at) bart-sokol.info_.
